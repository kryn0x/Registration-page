# Registration-page
Registration Page with Backend Integration
This project demonstrates a simple yet functional user registration system built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, running on a XAMPP server. The project is divided into two main components:

Frontend:
HTML/CSS: The registration form is created using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, ensuring a clean and responsive design.

Backend:
PHP: Handles form submissions, server-side validation, and interaction with the database.
MySQL: Stores user data such as usernames, emails, and passwords securely.
XAMPP: A local server environment used to host and test the application.
